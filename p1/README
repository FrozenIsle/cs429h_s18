Objective:
~~~~~~~~~~

- Become familiar with the project submission environment
- Become familiar with simple C constructs

Assignment:
~~~~~~~~~~~

(1) finish the implementation of p1
(2) donate a test case
(3) answer the questions in REPORT.txt

Problem:
~~~~~~~~

An ant is placed at the origin of a 2-D surface and will be taking steps that zig-zag through the
space as follows:

    16  .......
     | 
    15 - 14 - 13 - 12
                    |
     4 -  5 -  6   11
     |         |    |
     3 -  2    7   10
          |    |    |
     0 -  1    8 -  9

You need to write a program that takes a list of distances (each representing a number of step)
and prints the (x,y) coordinates for each distance on a separate line

for example:

./p1 0
0 (0,0)

./p1 1
1 (1,0)

./p1 2
2 (1,1)

./p1 0 1 2 1000000
0 (0,0)
1 (1,0)
2 (1,1)
1000000 (0,1000)

Rules
~~~~~

- Your program has to finish in 5 seconds or less
- Distance is in the range 0 to 1,000,000,000,000

Submitting a test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add a pair of files named <your csid>.test and <your csid>.ok

If your CSID is bob, the files will be called bob.test and bob.ok

The test file contains the arguments to be passed to the program and the ok file contains the
expected output. For example:

bob.test
0 1 2 1000000

bob.ok
0 (0,0)
1 (1,0)
2 (1,1)
1000000 (0,1000)

Look in t1.test and t1.ok for an example.

Files you're allowed to change:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   p1.c
   <csid>.test
   <csid>.ok

Files you're supposed to leave alone:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Everything else
   
To compile:
~~~~~~~~~~~

    make

To run tests:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make clean test

To make the output less noisy:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make -s clean test

To debug with gdb
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make
    gdb ./p1
    (gdb) run "10 20 30"
