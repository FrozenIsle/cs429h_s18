What will you do?
We want to add on to the fun language we created in p3. Namely, we want to include different data types like strings, doubles, characters, etc. We also want to
incorporate local variables and global variables. Finally, we want to include parameters for functions, and then utilize them within the function but not
affecting the variable that is being passed in.
